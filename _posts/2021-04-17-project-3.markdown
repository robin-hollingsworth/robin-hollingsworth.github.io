description: As a part of the UCSB Data Science Fellowship, I got the opportunity to serve on the Tutoring Committee and create a data science activity for an introductory data science course offered at UCSB. My module explored a dataset from Kaggle on post-undergraduate jobs and salaries. The class uses a Python package called _datascience_ and the module was created in a Jupyter Notebook.
